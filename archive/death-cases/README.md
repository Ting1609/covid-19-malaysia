## Notes on Malaysia COVID-19 death cases data

1. Most of the data are taken directly from the Desk of DG website.
2. Case numbers are based on the date reported by MOH, not by the date of death of patient.
3. For the history column, the unfilled one can imply for local transmission, under invesigation or undisclosed.
4. Not all treatment date and patient history are given out by MOH. You can help search for offical sources / news site to help fill it in.
5. A few patient such as 5 and 39 passed away at home before getting treatment / treated and had went back home.
6. The data provided is fully for educational / analytical purposes.
7. Starting from Case 142 (8/10/2020), info about the patient treatment & death date are simplified. As such, the date reported is replaced for death date.

🕯️ **May those who had lost in the battle rest in peace.**
